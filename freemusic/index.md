### ðŸŽ¼ Where Did the Sheet Music Go?

For years, I shared sheet music I had transcribed by ear â€” mostly from recordings, sometimes from memory â€” because I wanted to help others learn and play. But I've decided to take them all down.

### Here's why

Even if I never copied from a physical score, my transcriptions were still derivative works of copyrighted music. That matters. It matters to the composers, arrangers, publishers, and performers who rely on the integrity of that system to make a living.

I've spent the past several months studying copyright, licensing, and the ethical use of AI and music. That clarity now guides everything I share. Not just the parts that are convenient.

So, Iâ€™ve taken down the downloadable sheet music files.

### Going forward

I'll only share sheet music that falls into one of the following:

- **Public domain**, including verified arrangements  
- **Licensed** or used with explicit permission  
- **Original work** that is legally and ethically mine to distribute

I was never threatened except by my own ethical self. This is part of a broader shift in how I create and share: responsibly, publicly, and without shortcuts.

Thanks for understanding. If you're here to learn or teach music the right way, follow me on YouTube and let's take this journey together.
