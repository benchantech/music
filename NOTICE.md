# Notice of Sheet Music Removal

As part of a broader shift toward ethical content creation, all downloadable sheet music files previously hosted in this repository have been removed.

These included transcriptions created by ear, which, while not copied from sheet music, still constitute derivative works under copyright law.

I was never issued a takedown notice or legal threat. This decision was made voluntarily, guided by research into copyright law, licensing, and ethical use of generative tools in music.

### Going forward

Only the following types of content will appear here:

- Public domain works (confirmed by multiple sources)
- Works licensed with explicit permission
- Original compositions or arrangements I fully own and am legally allowed to distribute

No unlicensed transcriptions will be re-uploaded under any circumstances.

This decision aligns with my ongoing public commitment to responsible sharing of music and creative work.
