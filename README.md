# ðŸŽ¼ Sheet Music Ethics Archive

This repository once included downloadable sheet music transcribed by ear, shared in the spirit of learning and access. As of 2024, all such files have been removed.

## Why?

Even if the original transcriptions were made by ear and not copied from scores, they were still derivative works of copyrighted music. That matters â€” to composers, arrangers, publishers, and performers.

Iâ€™ve spent over 100 hours studying copyright, licensing, and the ethical use of AI and music. That clarity now guides how I share content, both here and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/benchanviolin).

## What's Next?

This repository may continue to include:

- Public domain music with verified sources
- Licensed works with explicit permissions
- Original works legally and ethically cleared for sharing
- Educational materials unrelated to infringing content

If you're looking to learn or teach music responsibly, you're in the right place.
