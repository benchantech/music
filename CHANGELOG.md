## [Unversioned] - 2024-06-28

### Removed

- Deleted all downloadable sheet music files that were transcriptions of copyrighted material.
- These files, while transcribed by ear and created for educational purposes, were still derivative works under copyright law.

### Added

- `LICENSE` file using the MIT License with added disclaimers about musical content.
- `README.md` updated to explain ethical takedown and future sharing standards.
- `NOTICE.md` added to formally document the sheet music removal and reasoning.

### Notes

- This takedown was voluntary and not the result of any DMCA request or external pressure.
- This marks a transition to a fully ethics-aligned sharing model: only public domain, licensed, or original works will remain or be added.
- The original commit history will remain intact for transparency, but all files containing unlicensed sheet music have been removed from the latest branch.
